POLLARD RHO ALGORITHM  --  VOW

Number of bits of the EC prime field (16/20/24/28/32): 28


Elliptic curve:   y^2 = x^3 + x + 44      (mod 268434997, 28 bits)

Order of the curve = 268446727

Number of workers = 6

Calculating point Q = kP      (k = 7514)

P = (x = 47793986, y = 101136283) (r =      194, s = 140723562599687)         (Base Point)
Q = (x = 46350518, y = 252047061) (r = 81651724, s = 234119827)         (Q = kP    )
